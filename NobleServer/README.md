# NobleServer
Minimal HTTP server for handling GET HTTP requests.
Handles sending frontend pages after requests are made from a browser.

Run the [build.sh](build.sh) to quickly start the server.
You will need to setup the [routing file](route/route.txt) to select what requests match with each file.
The default one will only handle converting the root path request into index.html.
